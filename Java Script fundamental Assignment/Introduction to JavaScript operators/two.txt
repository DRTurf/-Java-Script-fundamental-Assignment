In JavaScript, operators can be categorized 
based on their functionality into several groups.  


Arithmetic (Binary) Operators: Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
    Ex- "+", "-", "*", "/".

    Ex- "==", "!=", ">", "<", ">=", "<=", "&&", "||", "!".


Assignment Operators:Assign values to variables.
    Ex- "+=", "-=".


Unary Operators:Operate on a single operand.
    Ex- "++", "--".

Conditional (Ternary) Operator:Provides a concise way to write conditional statements.
    Ex- "let x = (a >= b) ? c : d".


Bitwise Operators:Perform bitwise operations on integers.
    Ex- "&", "|", "^".
