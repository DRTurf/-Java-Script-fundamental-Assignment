Precedence: refers to the priority of operators. 
            Higher precedence operators are evaluated first. 

Associativity: the order in which operators 
               with the same precedence are evaluated. 
               It can be either left-to-right or right-to-left.

Precedence and associativity are important because they 
determine the order in which operators are evaluated in 
expressions.
