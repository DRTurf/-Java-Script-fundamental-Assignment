Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in 
JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. 
Clear variable names make it easier to understand 
the purpose and functionality the code.

Ex-
    // Not-so-descriptive variable names
    let x = 10;
    let y = 5;
    let z = x + y;

    // Improved with meaningful variable names
    let numberOfCake = 10;
    let numberOfChocolate = 5;
    let totalNumberOfItems = numberOfCake + numberOfChocolates;
